const FAQS: Array<{ q: string; a: React.ReactNode }> = [
  {
    q: "How long does setup take?",
    a: <>About 30 minutes. We need your business hours, service area, pricing rules, and a phone number you'd like Anna to answer. Most teams are live by lunchtime.</>,
  },
  {
    q: "Does Anna sound like a robot?",
    a: <>No — we use the latest neural voices from ElevenLabs, fine-tuned to match your brand. Customers regularly assume Anna is a real person on the team.</>,
  },
  {
    q: "What languages does Anna support?",
    a: <>English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Dutch, and Portuguese out of the box. Custom languages on request.</>,
  },
  {
    q: "Can I keep my existing phone number?",
    a: <>Yes. We forward your existing line to Hearthline, or you can publish a new dedicated number. SMS / WhatsApp routing works the same way.</>,
  },
  {
    q: "Which CRMs do you sync with?",
    a: <>HubSpot, Pipedrive, Salesforce, Zoho, and ServiceTitan. Anything else can be added through Zapier or our REST API.</>,
  },
  {
    q: "What happens if Anna can't answer something?",
    a: <>She politely takes a detailed message, files it as a hot lead in your CRM, and escalates to whoever's on call. No customer is ever left hanging.</>,
  },
  {
    q: "Is my data secure?",
    a: <>Yes. All data is encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest (AES-256). We're SOC 2 Type II audited and GDPR compliant. We do not train on your customer data.</>,
  },
  {
    q: "How is pricing structured?",
    a: <>A flat monthly platform fee plus per-minute call usage. No per-seat pricing. Most home-service teams pay between $390 – $890 / month all-in. Book a demo for an exact quote.</>,
  },
  {
    q: "Can I try Hearthline before paying?",
    a: <>We offer a 14-day pilot — same setup, same Anna, no card required. We only invoice if you decide to keep her after two weeks.</>,
  },
  {
    q: "Can I host Hearthline myself?",
    a: <>Yes — the whole stack is open source under AGPL-3.0. A commercial license is available for white-labeling, reselling, or running closed-source forks. See the <a href="/docs">docs</a> for the self-host quick start.</>,
